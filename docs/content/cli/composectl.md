## composectl

A CLI tool for managing docker compose repository with secrets

### Synopsis

This CLI tool will manage your docker compose repository of all
services that you configured.

composectl will list out all the services you are currently running, or
has decrypted the secrets but not running, and service not used. You can
quickly specify which service to run, and it will decrypt all the secret
of each service and prompt you whenever there is a missing secret.

### Options

  -h, --help               help for composectl
  -r, --repo-path string   Path to selfhost repo (overrides default location)
```
