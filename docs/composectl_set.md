## composectl set

Set the configuration for the application

Set the configuration for the CLI application so
that it will remember the next time you execute a

It will create a .composectl directory which SHOULD be 
git ignored. 

The .composectl directory will be created besides the
executable unless the COMPOSECTL_LOCAL env is set to
the path of the .composectl directory

```
